## File contents

Contains a web app for grouping students in a class into teams. Features:

**Classes menu:** Users can upload a list of classes. They can either build them name by name from scratch, or by uploading a .csv text file. The file upload
option is specifically designed around the file format of class lists downloaded from Skyward. Upon creating classes, this menu allows users to edit, upload,
and delete their saved classes. Class lists are stored across sessions, so a user can upload a class list once and use it in the program moving forward.
'
**Team generator:** Users select a class list from their saved lists, or they can directly upload a new .csv file here to work with. After configuring which
students are absent and how big to make the groups, the program randomly groups the students into groups. From there, groups can be reshuffled and saved.
